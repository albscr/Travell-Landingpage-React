Through this website, I have learned to create applications in React with dynamic transitions according to the user's movement. This experience has allowed me to gain skills in implementing reusable components and creating an intuitive and fluid user interface. In addition, I have improved my ability to work with tools such as React Router and CSS Transitions to create smooth transitions between different sections of the page. This project has given me valuable experience to further develop my skills in creating web applications with React.
